# Banco de tiempo // Time-based currency
This repository includes the final project of DAM ("Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma"). The idea was to create an application that was capable of manage and administrate the data of the application for android "Banc del Temps".
The application for android is like a "Wallapop" but instead of trading money you have to trade "time". 

Example: If you help someone building a library for 1 hour you can get "1 hour token". With this, someone can help you for 1 hour with anything you need.
But first, you have to create a post to explain what you need and the users of the community will apply to help you.

This application is built with C# and it allows you to insert, modify or delete posts,users,"time tokens" and trades.
